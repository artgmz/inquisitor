# Inquisitor!

## Description:
A small web app as a first attempt at playing with Meteor development. Allows users
to take quizzes and save their scores, viewing them either on the global leaderboard
or isolated from other users in order to see improvement over time.

## Demo:
Feel free to clone the repo and run it locally, as it isn't currently hosted anywhere.

## Possible Future Improvements:
* Use slugs instead of raw IDs to prettify URLs.
* Allow logged-in users to create/edit quizzes.
* Allow multimedia upload for quiz questions.
* Create user profiles.
* Allow quiz scores to be set to private or public, instead of all being public.
* Allow integration with social networks for auth and sharing.
